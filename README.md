```bash
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma db push
pnpm db:seed
```

## 🗄️ Database Architecture & Management

### The Schema
The system organizes work into the following hierarchy:
- **Portfolio**: High-level strategic groupings.
- **Project**: Specific initiatives within a Portfolio.
- **Team**: Departments responsible for work (e.g., Dev, Sales, Marketing).
- **Ticket**: Individual tasks with statuses and assignees.

### Management Commands
| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `pnpm prisma db push` | Syncs schema changes to the local SQLite DB. |
| `pnpm db:migrate` | Generates SQL migrations for production. |
| `pnpm prisma studio` | Visual data explorer for all models. |

## 🔐 Authentication & Role-Based Access

Access is managed through three distinct roles:

1. **SUPER_ADMIN**: 
   - Global visibility across all Portfolios, Projects, and Teams.
   - Typically reserved for Department Heads or System Admins.
2. **USER (Internal Staff)**:
   - Manage tickets and project execution within assigned teams.
3. **CLIENT (Stakeholders)**:
   - External or internal partners who review and approve deliverables.
   - Limited to the Stakeholder Portal.
